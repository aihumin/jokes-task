# Jokes Task

## Setup

In this repository you'll find a `jokes.txt` file containing one joke per line (beware of empty lines). 

## Task

Build a CLI tool in a language of your choice that consists of the following input/output mechanism:
* Output: Display joke
* Input: Rate joke from 1-5

The overall goal is to make the tool as enjoyable as possible by utilizing the ratings as base input to find **or** dynamically
create new jokes in order to achieve higher ratings over time. A rating of 1 indicates "not funny" while 5 indicates "very funny".

You will receive a temporary OpenAI API key during the session to work with.
